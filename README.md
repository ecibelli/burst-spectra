This repository contains several versions of a script designed to analyze a particular acoustic cue in the production of certain consonants. The .R version shows the original script; the .md version presents a markdown report (created by the .rmd file) that embeds figures and code output directly in the report. 

**Study description:** The place of articulation (position in the mouth where a speech sound is made) of a stop consonant like "t" or "k" can be cued in part by the spectral properties of the stop burst (the noise made when the mouth first opens up to begin articulation of these sounds). This code takes several measurements of the burst spectrum and uses it to assess whether or not American English learners of Hindi are distinguishing between two place categories - dental and retroflex. This distinction is cued by position of the tip of the tongue (against the teeth vs. curled slightly back against the roof of the mouth). It is not found in English - the closest English sounds are "t" and "d", which both have the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge, behind the teeth - and is difficult for some learners to produce. 

The data and analysis is taken from my dissertation, which can be accessed here: https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt9tq441d9/qt9tq441d9.pdf
